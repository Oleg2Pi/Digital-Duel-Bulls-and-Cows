This is a project similar to the game "Cows and Bulls" (MVP), created to demonstrate the main functions and principles of the game.

Game Description: This is a logic game in which the computer guesses a number and the player tries to guess it by making guesses. For each guess, the computer gives a hint about how many numbers were guessed and are in their place (bulls) and how many numbers were guessed but are not in their place (cows).

Main functions:
1) Generating a random code combination. The function generates a random code combination of numbers. This combination will be used in a game where the player will have to try to guess this combination.
2) Entering user assumptions. The player can use the interface to enter his guesses about the code combination in the game "Cows and Bulls".
3) Testing assumptions and providing hints. The algorithm compares the player's guess with the given code combination in the game "Cows and Bulls" and gives hints about the number of "bulls" and "cows".
4) User interface. A user-friendly interface that allows the player to interact with the game, enter guesses and see hints in the game "Cows and Bulls".
5) Win/Loss. The screen displays a win or loss at the end of the game "Cows and Bulls" when the player correctly guesses the combination or exhausts all attempts.
